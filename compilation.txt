update requirements for heroku when adding pip packages:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

creating databases:
python
from app import db
db.create_all()
exit

when recreating databases:
make sure to put db.create_all() after all the db models so that tables are generated.
better to just delete tables when changes are made and recreate them with py console.
Throw in the following lines after the database models in app.py:
db.drop_all()
db.create_all()

when using additional imports:
add dependency listing to requirements.txt for deployment to heroku
